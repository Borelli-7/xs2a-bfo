== Migrated to PSD2 new yaml 1.3.12.

From now on, XS2A uses models and API's according to the last BG 1.3.12 .yaml file version.

== Fixed error mapping

Fixed 503 HTTP error code handling from SPI level.

== Fixed links in PIS Cancellation

From now on, PIS Authorisation links and PIS Cancellation Authorisation links have common building mechanism and conditions.

== Marked `instance_id` column in `tpp_info` table as deprecated

Starting from 15.1 `instance_id` column in `tpp_info` table is marked as deprecated and will be deleted in release 15.4.

== Extended role validation in XS2A endpoints

From now on, TPP role validation for `TPP-Roles-Allowed` header is improved and can handle not only endpoints like
`http://server-name/v1/payments/sepa-credit-transfers`, but also `http://server-name/bank-api/v1/payments/sepa-credit-transfers`.
This is implemented according to the `4.4 XS2A Interface API Structure` of BerlinGroup Implementation Guidelines.

== Removed deprecated AisConsent and PiisConsentEntity entities, removed LazyMigrationService for consents

Deprecated entities AisConsent and PiisConsentEntity and corresponding LazyMigrationServices were removed completely from project,
liquibase migration was added.

== Improved performance for consents export in CmsAspspAisExportApi

Consents export logic was changed due to removal of needless LazyMigrationServices, as a result consents export performance was increased.

==  Deprecated methods in AuthorisationSpi

Two methods in AuthorisationSpi were marked as deprecated(`AuthorisationSpi.startAuthorisation` and `AuthorisationSpi.getScaStatus`).
Their signatures will be changed in release 15.4, new models `SpiScaApproach` and `SpiScaStatus`
will be used instead of old ones `ScaApproach` and `ScaStatus`.

== Added DB indexes for application performance improving

Indexes were added to foreign key columns in payments- and consents- related tables inside CMS to improve the performance during PIS and AIS flows.
