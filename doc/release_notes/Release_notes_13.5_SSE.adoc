== Finalisation of BG yaml file v.1.3.11 implementation

XS2A completely implemented BG yaml v.1.3.11 changes, new fields of `CardTransaction` model (`valueDate` and `grandTotalAmount`)
are passed to SPI level (to `SpiCardTransaction` class).

== Fixed PIIS flow

PIIS flow was fixed to handle properly funds confirmation requests for both types of PIIS consents (ASPSP and TPP), fixed TPP PIIS flow in case of multiaccount PSU,
added validation of proper consent type in AIS and PIIS services to prevent usage of PIIS Consent-ID in AIS flow and vise versa,
added proper error response in case of unsupported PIIS service. Postman environment variables and tests were updated.

== Bumped hibernate-core version

Version of hibernate-core was bumped up to 5.4.24.Final
