== Bugfix: added validator for `dateTo` query parameter in get transaction list

From now on, query parameter `dateTo` is validated. It should be correct format (ISO_DATE, i.e. "2021-02-12") and after `dateFrom`

== Bugfix: handled empty SCA status from SPI

From now on, SCA status is handled on XS2A side and prevented from its NULL value.
