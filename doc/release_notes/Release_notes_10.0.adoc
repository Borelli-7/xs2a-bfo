== Call SPI for scaStatus on GET SCA Status request

ASPSP should have a possibility to update authorisation status from bank's internal system related to consent/payment confirmation due to the fact that not every system is capable of updating the status in CMS.
SCA status in CMS will be updated by status from SPI if it is not final.

Method AuthorisationSpi#getScaInformation was marked as deprecated and will be removed in 10.3 releases.
