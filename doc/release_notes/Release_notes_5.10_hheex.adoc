== Bugfix: payment type and payment product validation

From now on, all XS2A endpoints for TPP which deal with payment services, are being validated for proper payment type
and product before the request body validation. Wrong payment type causes `400 PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED` error, and
wrong payment product causes `404 PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`.
