== Authorisation refactoring

From now on, all authorisation objects for consent, payment and payment cancellation are persisted in a common table `authorisation` in database.
Itâ€™s enough to provide authorisationId and its type to retrieve authorisation object from CMS. The following authorisation types are available: `AIS`, `PIS_CREATION` and `PIS_CANCELLATION`.

`AuthorisationController` is responsible for authorisation in CMS API.

Field `authorisationType` was marked as deprecated in `CmsPsuAuthorisation`, use field `type` instead.

== Bugfix: payment type and payment product validation

From now on, all XS2A endpoints for TPP which deal with payment services, are being validated for proper payment type
and product before the request body validation. Wrong payment type causes `400 PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED` error, and
wrong payment product causes `404 PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`.

== SPI model change: checking confirmation code

Responses from ASPSP-Connector for checking AIS/PIS confirmation code were changed. Ais consent object used now
is `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.domain.consent.SpiConsentConfirmationCodeValidationResponse`. This object stores status of
AIS consent and status of its authorisation. For PIS payment the response is `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.domain.payment.response.SpiPaymentConfirmationCodeValidationResponse`, containing the authorisation status and payment transaction status.

== Bugfix: In case of XML format payments the response type is still "applications/json"

From now on, content-type of payment initiation is being saved in CMS database.
When TPP retrieves payment information (`GET /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}`) this content-type is passed to SPI level and returns back to XS2A.
In case when content-type is absent in database (read old payments) this value will be obtained from `Accept` header.
If ASPSP doesn't provide payment content-type TPP will receive content-type that was passed to ASPSP.
If there is no information about content-type from the above-mentioned resources (database, `Accept` header, SPI response) TPP will receive default value `application/json`.

== Remove "ownerAddressType" field from "AisConsent" object

Field `ownerAddressType` from `AisConsent` object was removed.

== Bugfix: Read Account Details request returns an error for global consent

From now on, AIS endpoint 'Read account details' (`GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}`) for global consent returns correct result with data by required account ID.

== Fixing expiration of one-off consents containing multiple accounts
From now on, expiration of one-off consents containing multiple accounts works as expected.
A one off consent containing multiple accounts expires, if following requests have been executed.

* `GET /v1/accounts` - once, for all accounts
* `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}` - once, for each account
* `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/balances` - once, for each account (only if the consent is permitted to get balances)
* `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions` - once, for each account (only if the consent is permitted to get
transactions)
* `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions/{transactionId}` - `t` times, for each account, where `t` is the number of
transactions attached to the account (only if the consent is permitted to get transactions)
