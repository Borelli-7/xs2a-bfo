== Deployment View


One of the main goals is to make this project adaptable to environment of customer.
Therefore we provide a set of Java libraries dependent on Spring framework.
The decision of the ways to include these libraries and how to deploy is on the integration project (SPI Development).

Nevertheless we highlight some major scenarios how we see the possible deployment of the application.
