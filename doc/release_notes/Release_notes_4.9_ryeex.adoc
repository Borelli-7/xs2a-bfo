== Bugfix: Payment endpoints return incorrect HTTP status code on providing unknown payment ID

From now on, PIS endpoints that take payment ID as a path parameter will return `RESOURCE_UNKNOWN` error with HTTP status
code `403` instead of `400` or `404` if the payment couldn't be located by the provided ID.

The following endpoints were affected by this change:

- Payment information request (`GET /v1/{payment_service}/{payment_product}/{payment_id}`)
- Payment initiation status request (`GET /v1/{payment_service}/{payment_product}/{payment_id}/status`)
- Payment cancellation request (`DELETE /v1/{payment_service}/{payment_product}/{payment_id}`)
