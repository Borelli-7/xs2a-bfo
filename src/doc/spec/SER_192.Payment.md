# XS2A interface –> Core services-> Payment Initiation Service

## Payment Initiation Service (PIS).
This service may be used by a PISP to initiate a single payment on behalf of a PSU using a given account of that PSU. The account is managed by the ASPSP providing the XS2A Interface.


	With Redirect SCA Approach
	If the ASPSP supports the Redirect SCA Approach, the message flow within the payment
	initiation service is simple. The Payment Initiation Request is followed by a redirection to the
	ASPSP SCA authorization site. A status request might be requested by the TPP after the
	session is re-redirected to the TPP’s system.

Transactions according to this use case can be used to initiate a single payment in form of a credit transfer from an account of the PSU to an account of the payee.

###  Request Body
The payment data to be transported in the request body are dependent of the chosen API
endpoint. Some standard definitions related to the above mentioned standard products are
defined below. Further definitions might be done community or ASPSP specific. ASPSP or
community definitions should reuse standard attribute names.


For core payment products in the European market, this document is defining JSON
structures, which will be supported by all ASPSPs
* offering the corresponding payment products to their customers and
* providing JSON based payment endpoints

At the same time, the ASPSP may offer in addition more extensive JSON structures for the
same payment products since they might offer these extensions also in their online banking
system.

![Payment schemes](img/PIS_JSON_usage.png)


The following table first gives an overview on the generic Berlin Group defined JSON
structures of standard SEPA payment products.

**Remark:** Extensions of these tables are permitted by this specification:
* if they are less restrictive (e.g. set the debtor account to optional) or
* if they open up for more data elements (e.g. open up the structured remittance information, or ultimate data fields.


          Attention: The ASPSP may reject a payment initiation request where additional data elements are used which are not specified.



### Response Header
The Location field is used as link to the created resource. No other specific requirements.

###  Response Body

Attribute | Type  | Condition | Description |
------- | ---------------- |  ---------  |  ---------
| transaction_status | Transaction status  |	Mandatory |	The values defined in the table “Transaction Status” (see below) might be used. |
| sca_methods | Array of authentication objects |	conditional |	This data element might be contained, if SCA is required and if the PSU has a choice between different authentication methods. Depending on the risk management of the ASPSP this choice might be offered before or after the PSU has been identified with the first relevant factor, or if an access token is transported. If this data element is contained, then there is also an hyperlink of type "select_authentication_methods" contained in the response body. These methods shall be presented towards the PSU for selection by the TPP. |
| chosen_sca_method | authentication object  |	conditional |	This data element is only contained in the response if the APSPS has chosen the Embedded SCA Approach, if the PSU is already identified with the first relevant factor or alternatively an access token, if SCA is required and if the authentication method is implicitly selected.  |
| _links | links  |	Mandatory |	A list of hyperlinks to be recognized by the TPP. **Remark:**  All links can be relative or full links, to be decided by the ASPSP. Type of links admitted in this response, (further links might be added for ASPSP defined extensions): *"redirect"* : In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link  to which to redirect the PSU browser. *"update_psu_identification"* : The link to the payment initiation resource, which needs to be updated by the psu identification. This  might be used in a redirect or decoupled approach, where the PSU ID was missing in the first request. *"update_psu_authentication"* : The link to the payment initiation resource, which need to be updated by a psu password and  eventually the psu identification if not delivered yet. This is used in a case of the Embedded SCA approach.  *"select_authentication_method"* : This is a link to a resource, where the TPP can select  the applicable strong customer authentication methods for the PSU, if there  were several available authentication methods. This link contained under exactly the same conditions as the data element “authentication_methods”, see above. *"self"* : The link to the payment initiation resource created by this request. This link can be used to retrieve the resource data. “status”: The link to retrieve the transaction status of the payment initiation |
| psu_message | string  |	Optional | Text to be displayed to the PSU |
| tpp_messages | Array of Message |   Optional	 |  |


#### Transaction Status

------- | ---------------- |  ---------
| ACCP |  AcceptedCustomerProfile |	Preceding check of technical validation was successful. Customer profile check was also successful. |
| ACSC | AcceptedSettlementCompleted | Settlement on th’ debtor's account has been completed.  Usage : this can be used by the first agent to report to  the debtor that the transaction has been completed.  Warning : this status is provided for transaction status  reasons, not for financial information. It can only be used after bilateral agreement  |
| ACSP | AcceptedSettlementInProcess | All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. |
| ACTC | AcceptedTechnicalValidation | Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful |
| ACWC | AcceptedWithChange | Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent. |
| ACWP | AcceptedWithoutPosting | Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor  customer’s account. |
| RCVD | Received | Payment initiation has been received by the receiving  agent. |
| PDNG | Pending | Payment initiation or individual transaction included in  the payment initiation is pending. Further checks and  status update will be performed. |
| RJCT | Rejected | Payment initiation or individual transaction included in   the payment initiation has been rejected. |

If the response is JSON based, then the Name entry is used, to get a better readability.
