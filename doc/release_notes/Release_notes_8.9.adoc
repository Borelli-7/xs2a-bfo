== Fixed AIS Consent checksum validation

From now on, AIS Consent checksum validation works properly for multi-account consents. Changing accounts order inside
consent doesn't change its checksum.

== Improved decoupled approach

From now on, decoupled approach has the same flow (request SCA methods, select SCA method) with embedded approach until TAN code generation.
Response SCA status will be retrieved from SPI level.

== Updated mapstruct version to 1.4.1.RELEASE

Mapstruct version updated to 1.4.1.RELEASE.

== Bugfix: adjusted `ATTEMPT_FAILURE` processing for consents

From now on, status `ATTEMPT_FAILURE` processed correctly.
