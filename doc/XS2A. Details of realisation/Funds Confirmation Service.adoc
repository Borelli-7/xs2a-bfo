The overall confirmation of funds service is separated in two phases:

* Establish PIIS consent (Optional);

* Perform the actual Confirmation of Funds through xs2a.

The first part is not mandated to be offered by the XS2A interface, since this could also be an online banking function or even a paper based consent process.

Parameter *piisConsentSupported* in the ASPSP-Profile, defines whether ASPSP supports storing PIIS consent in CMS (created through ASPSP-CMS-API).

If *piisConsentSupported = TRUE* then ASPSP stores PIIS consent in CMS and FundsConf request is validated according to this consent.

* If ASPSP doesn't provide PIIS Consent to the CMS and TPP requests Funds Confirmation, then response will contain *HTTP code  400 "NO_PIIS_ACTIVATION"*;
* If PIIS Consent is stored in CMS without TPP-Authorisation-Number , this PIIS consent can be used by any TPP;
* If TPP-Authorisation-Number is set in consent - PIIS consent is for particular TPP;
* Funds Confirmation should be requested by the same TPP which is written in Consent. In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with *HTTP code 400 CONSENT_UNKNOWN*;
* In case of TPP doesn't have appropriate role in the certificate for initiate Confirmation of Funds request then XS2A sends the response with *HTTP code 401 CERTIFICATE_INVALID* with message: “You don’t have permission to this resource”.

If *piisConsentSupported = FALSE* then PIIS consent is not stored in CMS and request is sent to SPI with NULL value. And ANY TPP may request Funds Confirmation.

=== PIIS Consent Statuses:
* While creating PIIS consent, In case of existing old valid consent for TPP, one PSU and one account (Mandatory)-its consent status becomes "RevokedByPSU" as soon as new one for the same TPP, the same PSU and the same account is created with status Valid.
